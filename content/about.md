description: "About me"

My name is Juan JosÃ© Molina (Juanjo) and I'm DevOps Engineer based in Barcelona, Spain. In this blog I'll be posting interesting issues I find at work, Linux and macOS workflows, side projects and maybe about music and other random subjects too. Feel free to reach out via Email or Instagram DMs if you've got any questions or if you just want to say hi ðŸ™‚

My operating system of choice is Fedora Linux, but I'm currently using macOS at work, therefore I end up using macOS in my free time too.

I've got 6 computers in total, in order by usage:
  - MacBook Pro 13' (Late 2015) - macOS Monterrey
  - Upgraded Thinkpad x240 - Fedora Linux
  - Toshiba Satellite from 2014 - Windows 10 Pro
  - Librebooted Thinkpad x200 - Void Linux
  - Two custom built computers - Windows 10

Software I use:
  - VS Code
  - Vim
  - Google Chrome
  - Amethyst (will make a post about it)
  - ZSH (With oh-my-zsh)
  - Element
  - DaisyDisk
  - NewNetwire
  - Podman 
  - Buildah
  - Docker & Docker Compose
  - Sequel Ace
